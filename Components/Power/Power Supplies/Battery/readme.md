# Batteries

> Portable Power Sources That Can Be Discardable Or Rechargeable

Batteries are everywhere these days as they can provide power on-the-go. This however is when things become confusing: There are...

* ...primary batteries (that cannot be charged), and rechargeable batteries. 
* ...different chemistries (i.e. *NiMH*, *Lead-Acid*, *LiIon*, *LiPo*, *LiFePo4*, etc.)
* ...different battery voltages and charging requirements

A great primer on battery fundamentals is [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGglJehON5g&ab_channel=Veritasium). It explains thoroughly how rechargeable batteries work, what the different cell chemistries are, and why some batteries are more dangerous than others.

## Overview
A battery cell stores energy chemically, and can supply this energy as electrical current. That's the common denominator of all battery cells. From here, it can get more complex:

* **Chemistry:**    
Depending on the chemistry used by the battery cell, it can be [rechargeable](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/), or it is designed for [one-time use](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/primary/) only (discardable). 
  
  The chemistry also determines the maximum safe cell voltage (i.e. *1.2V* for *NiMH*, *3.7V* for *LiFePo4*, *4.2V* for *LiIon/LiPo*). It also determines the [shelf life](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/unprotected/) and [energy density](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/unprotected/).
* **Battery Cell vs. Battery:**    
Each **battery cell** has a fixed  voltage that depends entirely on its chemistry. For example, all *NiMH* cells have a maximum voltage of *1.2V*. 

  In a **battery**, multiple cells are combined to achieve different voltages and/or capacities. By connecting cells *in series*, the voltage rises. By connecting them *in parallel*, the capacity rises. For clarity, **batteries** are often called [battery pack](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/), and even though *battery cells* have always the same voltage, **battery packs** can have all kinds of voltages and capacities.
* **Safety:**    
Some battery chemistries like *lithium* are so powerful that they need a [BMS](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/) to protect them from damage and protect you from fire hazards.

  Typically, the BMS is [built into the battery](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/), and you should always [make sure your battery has a BMS](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/#how-to-determine-if-a-battery-has-a-built-in-bms), but you can also explicitly get batteries with **no BMS** (unprotected). Such batteries have a [balancer cable](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/unprotected/) instead so you can shift the tasks of a BMS to external components and save weight and cost.

In this article you find answers to the following questions:

* What are the [different chemistries](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/) used in batteries in general, and how do they differ in terms of energy density, shelf life, and cost?
* Why can [discardable](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/primary/) batteries not be recharged like [rechargeable](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/) batteries?
* What are the [chemistries](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/#chemistry-types) used in rechargeable batteries, and how do they compare?
* What is the difference between a battery cell and a [battery pack](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/)?
* How can I [test](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytesters/) the quality and state of charge of a battery?
* What is a [BMS](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/), and how can I [find out if my battery has one](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/#how-to-determine-if-a-battery-has-a-built-in-bms)?
* Why do some rechargeable batteries have [no BMS and a balancer cable instead](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/unprotected/)?
* What are [fake batteries](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/fakebatteries/), and how can I identify them?

Hopefully this is helping you to pick the best battery type for your next project.
