# Power Management ICs

> Highly Integrated ICs Specifically For Charging (Sometimes Discharging, Too)


Modern power management ICs work in almost every powerbank but can also be used separately.

They typically resemble a combination of highly efficient buck- and/or boost converter, plus battery protection features typically found in BMS.

# Overview

Power management ICs integrate most of what is needed to charge batteries. Some power management ICs also include discharge capabilities and can output stabilized voltages from a battery.
