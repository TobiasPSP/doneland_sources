# INA3221 

> 3-Channel Current And Voltage Monitoring Via Shunt 

[INA3221](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina3221.pdf?ts=1720423291346) is a microchip from *Texas Instruments* that measures *current* and *voltage* for three different channels concurrently. Its primary limitations are:

* Load voltage must not exceed *26V*
* All loads and the chip must share a common *GND*

The chip is suited for analyzing complex power monitoring scenarios like *charging analysis for solar panels*: you can monitor *power generated by the solar panel*, *power going into a battery*, and *power consumption taken from the battery* all in one device.

*INA3221* is typically used in breakout boards that come with a *shunt resistor* and cost less than €2.00. but can also be used directly in own PCB designs.

> [!TIP]
> Breakout boards are available with *purple* and *black* PCBs which are technically *identical*. Avoid *old breakout board versions* (see below) as they have serious flaws.

## Quick Overview
The *INA3221* is a three-channel, *high-side* current and voltage monitor with I2C- and SMBUS-compatible interface. Its I2C address is *0x40*.


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Supply Voltage | 2.7V - 5.5V |
| Current consumption | 350uA (typical) |
| Detected Voltage | 0-26V, 8mV increments |
| Maximum Detected Current | depends on shunt resistor value, 4095 steps resolution |
| I2C Default Address | 0x40 (four addresses configurable) |

> [!NOTE]
> The device power supply (*VC*) and the three input channels are *separated*: bus voltages can be present with the supply voltage off and vice versa. To not influence measurements, the chip should be powered via a separate power source.

The chip has programmable conversion times
and averaging modes and offers both critical and warning alerts to detect multiple programmable out-of-range conditions for each channel. It supports both *3.3V* and *5V* environments.


### Measuring Voltages
The *current* is measured as a *voltage drop* across the *shunt resistor*. The *voltage* is measured as a *high side* measurement against *GND*:

Each channel has two connectors: *VNx+* and *VNx-*. *VNx+* must always be connected to the positive voltage (*high side*). *VNx-* then connects to the positive side of the load you want to measure.

In addition, all three channels **must share the same *GND***. The channel *bus voltage* is measured between *VNx-* and *GND*.



## Breakout Boards

*INA3221 breakout boards* are available in two colors that are functionally identical:

<img src="images/ina3221_top_both_t.png" width="70%" height="70%" />

With the *purple* version, the PCB traces are better recognizable. This helps to understand the *breakout board design*, and can more easily identify old PCB versions with their design flaw (see below).

### Avoid Old PCB Versions
The first version of this breakout board had a [serious design flaw](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/ina3221-breakout-board/482236) in which all three *IN+* pins were connected to each other. 

<img src="images/ina3221_oldversion.png" width="70%" height="70%" />



Because of this, the three *INA3221* channels always had to share the same positive voltage source. This made it impossible to use the board to measure i.e. *solar appliances* where you would want to measure *at different circuitry locations* with *different voltages*. The old board design required all three channels to use the same *high side* (positive input voltage).

<details><summary>How users fixed the old INA3221 breakout board design flaw</summary><br/>

Users initially fixed this *PCB design flaw* manually which worked but took a lot of cutting and reworking tracks. 


<img src="images/ina3221_fix.png" width="70%" height="70%" />

Depending on how it was done, the result wasn't always looking necessarily trustworthy either.


<img src="images/ina3221_fix_t.png" width="35%" height="35%" />

</details>   

The *PCB design* has meanwhile been fixed, and the tracks on the PCB have been redesigned completely. Compare the new track routing to the three channel solder pads with the earlier design above:


<img src="images/ina3221_fixedtracks.png" width="70%" height="70%" />


New PCBs without the flaw can be recognized on the top side by looking at the three big connectors: they are now labeled *VPU*, *GND*, and *GND*. The old version did not have labels (and used these pins differently).

### Caveat When Using Example Schematics
Since the *INA3221 breakout board* has undergone drastic redesign (as discussed above), this affects *examples* as well that you may find in the Internet.

Always make sure the *schematics* apply to the *same INA3221 breakout board version* you are using.

## Shunt Value and Maximum Current

*INA3221* measures current via *voltage drop* at a *shunt resistor*. The *INA3221* can sense this voltage drop in *40uV* increments up to a maximum of *163.8mV*, providing a 12-bit resolution with a total of 4.095 steps (one step is used internally).

The shunt resistor value is chosen so that with the maximum current to be measured the voltage drop across the shunt does not exceed *+/-163.8mV*.

The maximum current that can be measured depends on two factors:

* **Shunt Resistor Value:** With the default *0.1 Ohm* shunt resistor found on most breakout boards, a maximum current of *1.638A* can be measured. Likewise, a *1 Ohm* shunt resistor could measure currents of up to *0.1638A* at a higher precision.   
* **Tracks:** The *entire current* needs to go through the shunt resistor, so terminals and PCB tracks must be capable of handling this power.    

While you could replace the default *R100* SMD shunt resistor with i.e. a *R020* (*0.02 Ohms*) and now measure currents of up to *8A*, it is doubtful whether the PCB tracks would allow such currents. If you must measure higher currents, then use *external shunt resistors*. The PCB really just needs to be connected to the *voltage drop* this way.

> [!TIP]
> There is a [Power Monitor Tool](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SBOR021) available for free download from *Texas Instruments* which really is a *Microsoft Excel* sheet that lets you calculate the required *shunt resistor values* for your scenario.

## Pin Layout

Here are the pins exposed on typical breakout boards:

| Pin Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| IN1+ | positive pin of power supply for load 1 |
| IN1- | positive side of load 1 |
| IN2+ | positive pin of power supply for load 2 |
| IN2- | positive side of load 2 |
| IN3+ | positive pin of power supply for load 3 |
| IN3- | positive side of load 3 |
| GND | Common ground (must be shared with all connected loads) |
| VS | INA3221 power supply, 2.7-5.5V |
| SDA | I2C SDA |
| SCL | I2C SCL |
| PV | *power valid* alert, open-drain output |
| CRI | *critical* alert, open-drain output, *conversion*-triggered |
| WAR | *warning* alert, open-drain output, *average*-triggered |
| TC | *timing control* alert, open-drain output |
| A0 | defines the *I2C* address. Default address is *0x40* |

## I2C Address

By default, I2C address *0x40* is used but can be configured to one of four addresses by connecting pin *A0* to one of the pins below:

| I2C Address | Pin *A0* connected to pin |
| --- | --- |
| 0x40 | n/c |
| 0x40 | *GND* |
| 0x41 | *VS* |
| 0x42 | *SDA* |
| 0x43* | *SCL* |

To redefine the *I2C address* on the breakout board, pin *A0* is exposed on its front side, along with the four possible counterparts. Add a solder bridge to *one* of the other pins to set the *I2C address*. 

<img src="images/ina3221_top_i2c.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

If *no* solder bridge is present, the default *I2C* address *0x40* is used.



## Schematics
The *INA3221* is a *high side* device. Here are the rules:

* **Common Ground:** all loads that you want to measure, and the *INA3221*, **must share the same GND**.
* **High Side:** the positive pin of each channel must be connected to the positive power supply. The negative pin of the channel connects to the positive side of the load. The negative side of the load connects to the common **GND**.

### Example

This is an example of hooking up a *ESP32* microcontroller to the *I2C interface* of *INA3221*, and exposing three screw terminals for three different loads to be measured:


<img src="images/ina3221_basic_schematics.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you connect the positive power source that drives your load to *VNx+*, the negative power source to *GND*, the device's positive pole to the *VNx-*, and the device's negative pole to *GND*. All devices and power supplies must share the same *GND* with *INA3221*.


## Measurement Details
At its heart, *INA3221* is a *ADC* (*Analog-to-Digital Converter*) and can measure analog voltages.

*INA3221* performs *two measurements* on up to three power supplies of interest:

* **Current:** the current is measured indirectly as the *voltage drop* at the *shunt resistor* and is measured between *INx+* and *INx-*.
* **Voltage:** the *bus voltage* is measured between *INx-* and *GND*. 


If *bus voltage* is of no interest, its monitoring can be disabled (effectively also disabling "power valid alerts*). This enables the chip to focus entirely on *current monitoring* at a higher rate.

> [!TIP]
> Since the voltage drop at the *shunt resistor* is neglectible, the *bus voltage* is roughly the power supply voltage. The exact voltage (between *INx+* and *GND*) would have to take into account the voltage drop across the *shunt resistor* (which can be derived from the *current* measurements).

### Normal Mode
In *normal mode*, the chip continuously measures *shunt voltage*, then *bus voltage* for one channel, then moving to the next channel. Channels are measured sequentially. Channels can be independently *enabled* and *disabled*. *Disabled* channels are bypassed.

### Single Shot Mode
In *single shot mode*, the chip sequentially measures all *enabled* channels *once*, then enters a *power-down mode*. Values can still be read in this mode. They represent the last measurement cycle.

### Power Down Mode
*Power down mode* is entered automatically at the end of a measurement cycle in *single shot mode*, and can be entered manually as well. In this mode, *quiescent current* is reduced while all registes stay fully functional. Only the current flowing into *INA3221 inputs* is cut off. 

Wake up from this mode takes *40us*


## Alerts

*INA3221* supports four different *alerts* with programmable thresholds per channel. Alert states are available at designated pins. Breakout boards also connect these pins to built-in *LED* to indicate the alert state of the device:

<img src="images/ina3221_led.png" width="40%" height="40%" />


* **VS:** power supply to the board is present
* **PV:** all enabled channels have a *valid voltage* (*power valid*)
* **C:** at least one channel has exceeded the *critical current*
* **W:** at least one channel has exceeded the *warning current*
* **TC:** the *power rails* on *channel 1* and *channel 2* did not start up quickly enough (*timing control*)   
* **Critical:** very fast-acting alert that triggers whenever any enabled channel current exceeds a programmed threshold. Pin goes *low* in alert state. Can optionally use the *sum* of all enabled channels instead (provided all channels use the same *shunt resistor value*).
* **Warning:** less quickly-acting but more fault-tolerant alert that triggers when the *average* current exceeds a programmed threshold. Pin goes *low* in alert state.
* **Power Valid:** changes from *low* to *high* once all enabled channels reach a predefined voltage (by default *10V*). Goes back to *low* once any channel voltage drops below a second threshold (by default *9V*). As long as this pin is *high*, the device power supply is in expected shape. All thresholds can be reprogrammed to a minimum voltage of *2.7V*.
* **Timing-Control:** This is a very specific alert that can be used to ensure proper power-supply sequencing but requires appropriate assignment of channels to the power supplies in question. This alert is not used for most typical application. Here is how it works: At *power-up* only (or after a *reset*), the chip measures the *bus voltage* at *channel 1*, and once it exceeds *1.2V*, it continues to monitor the *bus voltage* at *channel 2*. If this voltage does not also exceed *1.2V* after *28.6ms* (four complete measurement cycles at default values), this pin pulls *low*, indicating that no valid power rail was present on channel 2.

## Conversion Time And Averaging

*Measurement errors* can occur: *current* is measured via *very low voltages*. Such voltages can be subject to *trace inductance* and other *parasitic impedances* between the *shunt resistor* and the chips *input pins*.

When using *breakout boards*, such interferences are minimized by the close proximity of the *shunt resistors*. When you are required to use *external shunt resistors* to measure large currents, *measurement errors* may become a problem.

### Noise And Errors
*INA3221* can limit the impact of *noise* on single *measurements* by two separate types of *averaging*:

* **Conversion Time:** this is the time the internal *ADC* can use to perform a *single* measurement. The more *conversion time* it is granted, the more accurate the results are: internally, the *ADC* uses its *conversion time* to take more samples, effectively averaging its single measurement.
* **Averaging:** *INA3221* can also average. It can take multiple *ADC measurements* and average them once more. 

Both techniques significantly decrease the effect of noise and increase the accuracy of measurements. The price you pay for both optimizations is a lower *response times*.

This graph illustrates the effect of *averaging*:

<img src="images/ina3221_averaging_t.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

In a nutshell, you can *optimize the accuracy* in a number of ways:

* **Hardware Design:** move the *shunt resistor* as close to the *INA3221 input pins* to minimize noise effects in the first place.   
* **Conversion Time:** give more time to the *ADC* for better sampling.   
* **Average:** average the raw *ADC* samples, effectively filtering out single bad measurements.   


> [!TIP]
> Good hardware design is most important: it minimizes noise, so expensive conversion time and post-averaging is less needed, effectively improving response time.
