# S2 Mini

> Powerful ESP32 S2 Board That Works With ESP8266 Shields


The pink [S2 Mini microcontroller board](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/s2/s2_mini.html) (aka *LOLIN S2 Mini* or *Wemos S2 Mini*) uses the *very powerful ESP32 S2 microcontroller* while keeping the *ESP8266 D1 Mini* form factor. The *S2 Mini* can continue to use *shields* designed for the *D1 Mini*.



<img src="images/s2_mini_top_overview_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


This enables the *S2 Mini* to continue to use *shields* that were designed for the *D1 Mini*, i.e. *battery shields*.

> [!NOTE]
> While the *S2 Mini* microcontroller board is exceptional *value for money*, the *S2* does not seem to be as *mainstream* as the original *ESP32* or its successors *C3* or *S3*: documentation for the *S2* is incomplete, and so is the *IDE support*: the *pins_arduino.h* file shipped with the *Espressif ESP32 Kit* for example needs manual tweaking just to be able to use common pin labels like *D0* or *D1* in your code. So if you are looking for a great microcontroller board with best bang for the buck, then *S2 Mini* is for you. If your focus is on boards that run flawlessly out of the box, then you might want to invest a little more and get a *S3*.






## S2 Mini Technical Data

The *S2 Mini* uses a *ESP32 S2* main processor:

Due to its form factor, the *S2 Mini* does not expose *all available hardware pins*. With *27 GPIOs*, this board is most sufficient for most *DIY projects*.

| Normal (WiFi) | 310mA peak |
| Modem-Sleep | 12-19mA |
| Light-Sleep | 450uA |

| Operating Voltage | 2-6V |
| Max current | 500mA@4.3Vin/3.3Vout |


### Pins And Compatible Shields

The board comes with 32 pins in 2x2 rows of 8. The *outer* pins are *compatible with ESP8266 D1 Mini* pins. *D1 Mini-compatible shields* can be used:

<img src="images/s2_pins.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

Specifically, the pins for *GND*, *3.3V*, and *VBus* (*5V*) are hardware-identical:


<img src="images/esp32_s2_shield_pns_top_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


This allows users to continue to use i.e. *battery shields* to add *charging* and battery power supply via existing *D1 Mini Shields* for *portable projects*:


<img src="images/esp32_s2_shield_side_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


> [!CAUTION]
> *Software-configurable* pins (such as *GPIOs* and the pin for the built-in *LED*) are **not compatible** with *ESP8266 D1 Mini*. Since these pins can be adjusted freely in software in the *S2*, converting software from *ESP8266 D1 Mini* to *S2 Mini* is a matter of checking and potentially reassigning pin numbers.

### S2 Mini Pinout


The pin numbers printed on the backside of the breakout board represent the exposed *GPIO* numbers. I.e., pin marked *1* represents *GPIO1*.

## Prototyping

The *S2 Mini* uses *dual line header pins* (2x8 pins on both sides for a total of 32 pins).


<img src="images/s2_mini_dual_header_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


This design was necessary to keep the *hardware compatibility* to the predecessor *ESP8266 D1 Mini* board: the *outer* 8-pin headers match the header pins in a *ESP8266 D1 Mini* (for power and *GND* pins at least).

You cannot of course use *dual line header pins* with a prototyping bread board as this would *short circuiting* both header pin lines.

### Soldering Header Pins

For prototyping, it makes most sense to solder the *outer* header pins normally for a *ESP8266 D1 Mini*-compatible foot print. 


<img src="images/esp32_s2_prototyping_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


The *inner* header pins should *not be connected* to the bread board. Instead, solder the header pins *on top*: this way, the additional pins can be connected using *female DuPont cables*.

## Fixing Missing Pins

When programming the *S2 Mini* in *platform.io*, the translation between true *hardware pins* and *common pin labels* is performed automatically: the *IDE* looks up the appropriate version of the file *pins_arduino.h* in the folder *%USERPROFILE%\.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoespressif32\variants\lolin_s2_mini*.

### Pin Declarations Missing

At the time of this writing, the appropriate file *pins_arduino.h* does exit but is incomplete. It does not define the *common pin labels* for all *digital pins*. 

Whenever you try and compile source code that refers to a **D*x*** pin, compilation files with an exception.

There does not seem to exist an *officially updated version* of this file. To fix, you have two choices:

* **Quick Fix:** Replace the *common pin labels* in the code with the actual *hardware pin* numbers. Since with *S2 Mini* the numbers are identical, you would i.e. change *D2* by *2*. If you do this, the code will compile but is now *specific* for *S2 Mini* and will no longer work on different microcontroller boards.
* **Permanent Fix:** Open the file *%USERPROFILE%\.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoespressif32\variants\lolin_s2_mini\pins_arduino.h* in a text editor, and add the missing declarations. You find an example below. When you do this, you might lose your changes with the next update of the *espressif32 arduino framework*, though.

## Uploading Firmware
These are the steps to upload new firmware to *S2 Mini* using *platformio*:

1. Connect *S2 Mini* to computer using USB-C cable. Make sure to use a *data cable* and not just a *power cable*.
2. Hold button *0*, then short-press button *RST*. Once you release button *RST*, the computer should play the sound for *new USB device discovery*.
3. Upload the firmware in *platformio* by clicking *Upload*. *Platformio* will search for a port, then force the *S2 Mini* in reset, and then find a port and upload the sketch.
4. Once the upload is done, short-press *RST* again. Now, the sketch should execute.

If the *S2 Mini* is *not recognized* by your computer (no "new USB device" sound plays after you pressed the keys as described above), make sure the *USB cable* is fully plugged in, try and reverse the plugs, and use a different cable. Apparently, the *USB connectors* on this board do not always have proper contact. Trying with a different *USB cable* did occasionally solve the issue.

If the issue persists, check to see whether the board gets warmer as usual. The build quality of these boards is not always great, and there have been instances where solder residue was short-circuiting CPU contacts. Closely inspect the board and all solderings.
